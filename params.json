{"name":"Standing Desk App","tagline":"Schedule periods of sitting and standing with menubar application","body":"# Standing Desk App\r\n\r\n**Standing Desk App** is a small utility by **Puppy Bongos** created to time how long you sit and stand while using a standing desk (or even just to remind you to stand up from sitting at a normal desk), all so you don't die from *butt death*.\r\n\r\n*Butt death* is the worst kind of death.\r\n\r\n### Why Make This App?\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is one particular company (WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS (FOR NOW)) that makes a swell application for Windows that provides similar capability. Their OS X version, however, is buggy and difficult to install, so Standing Desk App was created to fix those issues and make it even better.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Ridiculously simple install and setup\r\n* Minimal interface: all main program functions are run from the menubar\r\n* Set snooze and pause-on-idle times, in addition to the obvious sitting and standing ones\r\n* Pause timer if you know you're going to be away (or you want to cheat)\r\n* Uses both notifications and sound alerts to remind you of the next action\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n---\r\nDownload [Standing Desk App](https://github.com/michaelchadwick/standing-desk-app/standing-desk-app.dmg) and double-click the DMG file that appears on your local hard drive.\r\n\r\nA folder will appear where you can drag the Standing Desk App.app file to your /Applications directory.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n---\r\n\r\nDouble-click the .app file once it's installed. If it's your first time running the application, the Preferences window will appear, giving you a chance to peruse default settings and change them, if need be. Check the box that's labeled \"Start application at login?\" if you wish to never have to double-click the app ever again.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n---\r\nThe Preferences window (which can be accessed from the main menubar icon) allows you to change the following settings:\r\n\r\n**General**  \r\n* Standing time\r\n* Sitting time\r\n* Pause after idle time\r\n* Snooze time\r\n* Start on login option\r\n\r\n**Alerts**\r\n* Stand alert sound, and its volume\r\n* Sit alert sound, and its volume\r\n\r\n### Questions, Feedback, Suggestions\r\n* [puppybongos@gmail.com](mailto:puppybongos@gmail.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
