# Standing Desk App

[Standing Desk App](http://sda.codana.me) is a small utility by [Puppy Bongos](http://puppybongos.wordpress.com) created to time how long you sit and stand while using a standing desk (or even just to remind you to stand up from sitting at a normal desk), all so you don't die from *butt death*.

**Butt death** is the *worst* kind of death.

### Why Make This App?
---

There is one particular company (WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS (FOR NOW)) that makes a swell application for Windows that provides similar capability. Their OS X version, however, is buggy and difficult to install, so Standing Desk App was created to fix those issues and make it even better.

### Features
---

* Ridiculously simple install and setup
* Minimal interface: all main program functions are run from the menubar
* Set snooze and pause-on-idle times, in addition to the obvious sitting and standing ones
* Pause timer if you know you're going to be away (or you want to cheat)
* Uses both notifications and sound alerts to remind you of the next action

### Installation
---
Download the latest release of [Standing Desk App](https://github.com/michaelchadwick/standing-desk-app/releases) and double-click the DMG file that appears on your local hard drive.

A folder will appear where you can drag the Standing Desk App.app file to your /Applications directory.

### Usage
---

Double-click the .app file once it's installed. If it's your first time running the application, the Preferences window will appear, giving you a chance to peruse default settings and change them, if need be. Check the box that's labeled "Start application at login?" if you wish to never have to double-click the app ever again.

### Configuration
---
The Preferences window (which can be accessed from the main menubar icon) allows you to change the following settings:

**General**    
* Standing time  
* Sitting time  
* Pause after idle time  
* Snooze time  
* Start on login option

**Alerts**  
* Stand alert sound, and its volume  
* Sit alert sound, and its volume  

_Note_: Custom sounds can be added to the program by putting them in your ~/Library/Sounds directory. Any format (WAV, AIF, MP3, etc.) that OS X supports will work.
