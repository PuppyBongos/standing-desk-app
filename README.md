## Standing Desk App

**Standing Desk App** is a small utility by **Puppy Bongos** created to time how long you sit and stand while using a standing desk (or even just to remind you to stand up from sitting at a normal desk), all so you don't die from *butt death*.

*Butt death* is the worst kind of death.

### Why Standing Desk App?
---
There is one particular company (WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS (FOR NOW)) that makes a swell application for Windows that provides similar capability. Their OS X version, however, is buggy and difficult to install, so Standing Desk App was created to fix those issues and make it even better.

### Features
---

* Ridiculously simple install and setup
* Minimal interface: all main program functions are run from the menubar
* Set snooze and pause-on-idle times, in addition to the obvious sitting and standing ones
* Pause timer if you know you're going to be away (or you want to cheat)
* Uses both notifications and sound alerts to remind you of the next action

### Installation
---
Download [Standing Desk App](https://github.com/michaelchadwick/standing-desk-app/sda.dmg) and double-click the DMG file that appears on your local hard drive.

A folder will appear where you can drag the Standing Desk App.app file to your /Applications directory.

### Usage
---

Double-click the .app file once it's in there and the preferences window will pop up on initial load so you can change the default settings, if need be. If you want, there is an option in the Preferences window to run the app on login, so you won't need to be clicking on the app anymore.

### Configuration
---
The Preferences window (which can be accessed from the main menubar icon) allows you to change the following settings:

**General**  
* Standing time
* Sitting time
* Pause after idle time
* Snooze time
* Start on login option

**Alerts**
* Stand Alert Sound, and its volume
* Sit Alert Sound, and its volume
